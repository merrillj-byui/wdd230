            <h2>Enos 1:12</h2>
            And it came to pass that after I had prayed and labored with all
            diligence, the Lord said unto me: I will grant unto thee according
            to thy desires, because of thy faith.

            <h2>Ether 12:6</h2>
            And now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these things;
            I would show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped
            for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for
            ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith.
